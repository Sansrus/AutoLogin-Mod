# AutoLogin Mod
A simple mod for automatically entering passwords on servers

This mod gives you the opportunity NOT to enter your password every time you are asked to do so. In the mod interface, you can add/remove a password for each server.



## Commands

```
/autologin add <password>
```
- this command adds the password for the server you are currently on. If you already had a password, update it.


```
/autoreg
```
- the command will create a password for the server and automatically enter the command: "/register "

 ### The commands have shortened versions: /al and /ar, respectively.
  
## Features
It is also possible to generate a 15-character password and select a trigger word that the mod will check to determine if you need to enter a login command.

When you select a password, you can press the Del button to delete or Ctrl + C to copy the password.

The mod also supports nickname operation: Each nickname has its own password list.
